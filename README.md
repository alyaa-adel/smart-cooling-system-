In this project, we aim to develop a smart temperature-controlled cooling system that ensures a comfortable environment by automating temperature regulation. The key features of this system include:

Temperature Sensing and Control: We will use an appropriate sensor to continuously monitor the room temperature. When the temperature exceeds 30°C, the system will automatically activate a fan or air conditioner to cool the room, ensuring optimal comfort.

Real-Time Temperature Display: The current room temperature will be displayed on an LCD screen. This allows users to monitor the temperature at a glance and provides transparency regarding the system’s performance.

Automatic Turnoff Mechanism: To enhance energy efficiency and prevent unnecessary cooling, we will implement an automatic turnoff feature. After a specified time interval, the system will automatically turn off the fan or air conditioner, reducing power consumption and extending the lifespan of the cooling equipment.

By integrating these features, this project aims to create a user-friendly and energy-efficient solution for maintaining comfortable indoor temperatures, contributing to both convenience and sustainability.
